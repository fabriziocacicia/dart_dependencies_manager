# Base Dart Template 
The base template that all the dart projects should create from.

Updated to [v0.8.0](https://github.com/fabriziocacicia/template_base/releases/tag/v0.8.0) of [template_base](https://github.com/fabriziocacicia/template_base).

## Features
- PR Auto Labeler: automatically labels all PRs based on their type specified in the title (chore:, docs:, feat:, etc...)
- `.gitignore`: exclude all the most common file generated by the JetBrains IDEs and macOS specific files
- Keep History Conventional: keeps in the commits history of the `main` branch only the commits that follows the [Conventional Commits][1] convention
- Conventional PR Titles: checks that the title of PRs follows the [Conventional Commits][1] convention
- Delete Tags without Release: deletes all the tags without an associated release during the initial setup of the repository
- Check for Template new Release: periodically checks if the template from which the repository is derived has a new release and create an PR to handle the changes
- Dart Format and Analyze: checks that all the dart files follows the dart formatting and analyze the project sources
